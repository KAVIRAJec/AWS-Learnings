## AWS Disaster Recovery Strategies
#### 1. **Backup and Restore**
#### 2. **Pilot Light**
#### 3. **Warm Standby**
#### 4. **Multi-Site**
![alt text](image-1.png)

#### RPO (Recovery Point Objective): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
#### RTO (Recovery Time Objective): The maximum acceptable amount of time to restore the system after a disaster.

#### 1. **Backup and Restore:**
- **Description**: This strategy involves regularly backing up data and applications to a separate location. In the event of a disaster, the data can be restored to a new environment.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for non-critical applications where downtime is acceptable, and data loss can be tolerated.
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective, simple to implement, and easy to manage.
- **Disadvantages**: Longer recovery time, potential data loss, and requires manual intervention for recovery.
- **Example**: Backing up data to Amazon S3 and restoring it to a new EC2 instance in case of failure.

#### 2. **Pilot Light:**
- **Description**: This strategy involves maintaining a minimal version of the environment running in the cloud. In the event of a disaster, the environment can be scaled up to full capacity.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require a quick recovery time but can tolerate some downtime.
- **Advantages**: Faster recovery time compared to backup and restore, lower costs than a fully active environment.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires some manual intervention to scale up the environment, and may not be suitable for all applications.
- **Example**: Running a minimal version of a web application in AWS and scaling it up in case of a disaster.

#### 3. **Warm Standby:**
- **Description**: This strategy involves maintaining a scaled-down version of the environment running in the cloud. In the event of a disaster, the environment can be quickly scaled up to full capacity.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require a quick recovery time and can tolerate some downtime.
- **Advantages**: Faster recovery time compared to pilot light, lower costs than a fully active environment.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires some manual intervention to scale up the environment, and may not be suitable for all applications.
- **Example**: Running a scaled-down version of a web application in AWS and scaling it up in case of a disaster.

#### 4. **Multi-Site:**
- **Description**: This strategy involves running multiple active environments in different locations. In the event of a disaster, traffic can be redirected to the other environment.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for mission-critical applications that require high availability and minimal downtime.
- **Advantages**: Minimal downtime, high availability, and automatic failover.
- **Disadvantages**: Higher costs, complex architecture, and requires careful planning and management.
- **Example**: Running a web application in multiple AWS Regions and redirecting traffic to the other Region in case of a disaster.
