## AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center, office, or colocation environment directly to AWS.

**Key Features:**
1. **Dedicated Connection**: Establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Bypass the public internet, you can achieve more consistent network performance, security and lower latency.
2. **High Bandwidth**: Supports high bandwidth connections, ranging from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps. Ideal for large data transfers, backup, and disaster recovery.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Integrate on-premises infrastructure with AWS cloud services, enabling hybrid cloud architectures.
4. **Multiple Locations**: Connect to multiple AWS regions and services from a single Direct Connect location. This allows for efficient routing and reduced latency.
5. **Virtual Interfaces**: 
    - Public VIF: Access AWS public services like S3, DynamoDB, etc.
    - Private VIF: Access VPC resources using private IP addresses.
    - Transit VIF: Connect to AWS Transit Gateway for interconnecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.

**How It Works:**
1. **Choose a Location**: Select an AWS Direct Connect location to establish your connection. AWS has Direct Connect locations in various regions worldwide.
2. **Create a Connection request**: Create a Direct Connect request in the AWS Management Console.
3. **VIF Configuration**: Configure virtual interfaces (VIFs) to connect to AWS services or VPCs. You can create public, private, or transit VIFs based on your requirements.
4. **Connect to AWS**: Use Direct Connect to connect to Multiple AWS services, VPCs, or on-premises data centers. You can also use Direct Connect Gateway to connect to multiple VPCs in different regions.


**Interview Questions:**
1. **What is LAG in AWS Direct Connect?**
   - LAG (Link Aggregation Group) allows you to bundle multiple Direct Connect connections into a single logical connection. This increases bandwidth and provides redundancy.
