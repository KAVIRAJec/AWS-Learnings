## AWS Security Services
AWS Security Services are designed to help organizations protect their data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud. These services provide various security features, including threat detection, data protection, identity and access management, and compliance monitoring. 

## Key AWS Security Services
- **AWS GuardDuty**
- **AWS Security Hub**
- **AWS Inspector**
- **AWS WAF**
- **AWS Shield**
- **AWS Firewall Manager**

1. **AWS GuardDuty**: A threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3.
   - **Use Cases**: Detecting compromised EC2 instances, identifying unusual API calls, and monitoring for unauthorized access to S3 buckets.
   - **Example**: GuardDuty can alert you if it detects a compromised EC2 instance that is communicating with known malicious IP addresses.

2. **AWS Security Hub**: A centralized security service that provides a comprehensive view of your security state across AWS accounts and services. It aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes security alerts from various AWS services and third-party solutions.
   - **Use Cases**: Centralizing security findings, compliance checks, and integrating with third-party security solutions.
   - **Example**: Security Hub can aggregate findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, and other services to provide a unified view of your security posture.

3. **AWS Inspector**: An automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. It automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices.
   - **Use Cases**: Identifying vulnerabilities in EC2 instances, assessing network configurations, and ensuring compliance with security standards.
   - **Example**: Inspector can scan your EC2 instances for known vulnerabilities and provide a detailed report of the findings.

4. **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: A web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
   - **Use Cases**: Protecting web applications from SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks. It works on Layer 7 of the OSI model.
   - AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) can block all requests except the ones that you allow.
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF) can be applied to Amazon CloudFront distributions, Application Load Balancers (ALB), and API Gateway.

5. **AWS Shield**: A managed DDoS protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. It provides two levels of protection: Standard and Advanced.
    - **Shield Standard**: Automatically protects all AWS customers from the most common and frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks.
    - **Shield Advanced**: Provides additional detection and mitigation against larger and more sophisticated DDoS attacks, along with 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT).
   - **Use Cases**: Protecting against DDoS attacks, ensuring application availability, and providing real-time attack visibility.

6. **AWS Firewall Manager**: A security management service that simplifies the administration and maintenance of firewall rules across multiple AWS accounts and resources. It allows you to centrally configure and manage AWS WAF rules, Shield Advanced protections, and VPC security groups.
   - **Use Cases**: Centralizing firewall rule management, ensuring consistent security policies across accounts, and automating the deployment of security rules.
   - **Example**: Firewall Manager can automatically apply WAF rules to all your CloudFront distributions across multiple AWS accounts.
